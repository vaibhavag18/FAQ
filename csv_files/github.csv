In GitHub, you can use the term 'pull request' to refer to either concept.

In Git, a pull request is a command that fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local repository.

2. Open the conflicting file in a text editor: Once you've identified the conflicting files, open them in a text editor to see the changes.
3. Resolve the conflict: Look for lines that have been marked with a <<<<<<<, =======, or >>>>>>> symbol. These lines indicate where the conflict is.
4. Make changes to resolve the conflict: You can edit the conflicting file to resolve the conflict. If you're using a Git client, you can use the 'git merge --abort' command to abort the merge and try again.
5. Commit the changes: Once you've resolved the conflict, commit the changes with a clear message.
6. Push the changes: Finally, push the changes to GitHub.

It's also a good idea to review the commit history to ensure that the changes are correct.

Remember, resolving merge conflicts can be challenging, so don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it!"
